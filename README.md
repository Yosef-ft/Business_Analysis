# TellCo Data Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to understand customer behavior and engagement using exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a telecom dataset. By examining user data, we seek to identify patterns, outliers, and insights to inform business decisions and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Goals
1. Identify Key Handsets and Manufacturers
2. Analyze User Behavior on Applications
3. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


# Next Steps
* User Engagement Analysis: Further analyze user engagement metrics and cluster users based on their behavior.
* Experience Analytics: Evaluate network performance and device characteristics to improve user experience.
* Satisfaction Analysis: Assess customer satisfaction based on engagement and experience metrics and build predictive models.
* For detailed scripts and analysis, please refer to the provided Python notebooks.
